		<h2>Wherefore Art Thou Doctor Who?</h2>

		<div class="special">
			<p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.</p>
		</div>

		<p>I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You've swallowed a planet! You hit me with a cricket bat. You've swallowed a planet! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</p>

		<p>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
